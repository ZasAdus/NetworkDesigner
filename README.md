# NetworkDesigner
Author: Dawid Ciuba

Plan for the project: "The project will concern LAN networks and will be an educational application for people entering the world of computer networks.
I will try to create an application that will allow you to add routers and switches and will allow you to configure these devices in a simplified way.
I also plan to develop a user interface where you can select items and connect them together."

How to use app:
    1) When you launch app (main_screen.py) you will see main interface:
        a) On top there are radio buttons for switching between modes of the application.
        In design mode you can place/connect devices.
        In configuration mode you can configure devices.
        b) on the left you can see icons of the devices and two buttons,
        If you want to put some devices on the canvas just select one, and then click on the canvas. You will be able to add as many as you want.
        When you click 'Connect Devices' you will be able to connect devices, just make double click on the first device and then double-click on another one
        When you click 'Clear Design' you will get rid of the design you made, also configuration will be gone.
        c) When you enter configuration mode, just double-click on device and table with configuration will be shown to you,
        with information to which device you are connected on different ports
        d) Number of ports are limited for different types of devices (Router - 4, Switch - 8, Computer - 1).
